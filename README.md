# Hedonic-regression-to-estimate-willingness-to-pay-to-avoid-air-pollution-in-London

In this report, non-market amenity (air quality) is valued by estimating hedonic house price regressions using STATA, on a sample of housing transactions made in London, England.

Using the specified regression model, a hedonic house price year-quarter index is estimated using your regression model to capture the variation in housing values across time, and it is compared to the actual index to measure it's accuracy.
